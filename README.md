# AccuFact
Powerful machine learning algorithm used in detecting misinformation

I used a publically resourced fake news data sets to build a prediction model using Sklearn's python library, along with Pandas & NLTK for natural word processing. The prediction model is fairly accurate at 90% accuracy thanks to the large fake-news datasets. The web app generates custom .csv forms for each submission and feeds data to the model. Another Flask app is required to have it working on AWS.
